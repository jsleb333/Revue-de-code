    "## What is a callback?\n",
    "A callback is an object that will execute specific actions that will be called at specific times. They serves as a way to alleviate the algorithm from unrelated actions, since they can take up several lines in the code. Examples of callbacks include:\n",
    "- Following the progression in the console or with logs\n",
    "- Making checkpoints of a model\n",
    "- Saving results at each step\n",
    "- Handling multiple break conditions in _for_ loops\n",
    "- Etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this setup, each of these action will be an individual callback, and each of these is responsible to fulfill its goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us explain further this concept with the help of an example. Suppose we want to implement an algorithm with 2 main parts. We want to execute code _not_ related to the algorithm itself in between. To achieve this without altering the algorithm conciseness, we define the following generic Callback object:"
